                    <h2>On the Subject of Shorting Subcircuits</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">This circuit looks complicated, but maybe if I could break it down...</p>

                    <p>
                        Presented before you is a KTANE_SS series logic board. Each KTANE_SS series board controls a
                        fundamental part of the bomb, such as the timer, the strike controller, etc. To safely disarm
                        the module, you must identify the subcircuits of the logic board and short the connections
                        between them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Identifying Subcircuits</h3>
                    <p>
                        A <em>subcircuit</em> is a set of integrated circuits (ICs) such that electricity can flow
                        between every IC in the set, either directly or through another IC in the subcircuit. Note that
                        electricity only flows along connections in one direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To identify which ICs electricity can flow to from a particular IC, hold the red multimeter
                        probe on the "source" IC (where electricity flow originates). This will cause the LED of the
                        "source" IC to flash and the LEDs of each connected "destination" IC (where electricity flow
                        terminates) to light up. Remember that electricity only flows in the indicated direction (i.e.,
                        if electricity flows from IC 02 to IC 05, it does
                        <em>not</em> flow from IC 05 to IC 02).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Example of Subcircuit Identification</h4>
                    <p>
                        For example, if electricity can flow from IC 01 to IC 02, from IC 02 to ICs 03 and 04, and from
                        IC 03 to ICs 01 and 04, then ICs 01, 02, and 03 form a subcircuit. Since electricity cannot flow
                        from IC 04 to ICs 01, 02, or 03, it is not part of the subcircuit.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Disarming the Module: Shorting Connections</h3>
                    <p>
                        To disarm the module, the connections between subcircuits must be shorted. This will involve
                        shorting individual connections from ICs in one subcircuit to ICs in a different subcircuit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have identified each subcircuit present on the logic board, you must find the single
                        subcircuit from which electricity cannot flow to another subcircuit. This will be called a
                        <em>terminal subcircuit</em>. Any subcircuits from which electricity can flow to another
                        subcircuit will be called <em>internal subcircuits</em>.

                    <p>
                        To short a connection between two ICs, place the red probe on the "source" IC in the internal
                        subcircuit and place the black probe on the "destination" IC in the terminal subcircuit. The
                        power supply will automatically short the connection after 2 seconds. Shorting any other
                        connection or attempting to short a non-existant connection will result in a strike. To cancel a
                        short, remove the black probe from the IC that it is touching.

                    <p>
                        Note well that to <em>safely</em> disarm the module,
                        <em>you may only short connections from internal subciruits to terminal subcircuits</em> (i.e.,
                        you must short all connections which lead <em>into</em> terminal subcircuits).
                        <em>Shorting a connection may cause an interal subcircuit to become a terminal subcircuit</em>.
                        Once all connections between subcircuits are <em>safely</em> shorted using the guidelines listed
                        above, the module will be disarmed.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Example of Safely Shorting Subcircuits</h4>
                    <p>Consider three subcircuits which have been identified as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subcircuit A contains ICs 00 and 01</li>
                        <li>Subcircuit B contains ICs 02 and 03</li>
                        <li>Subcircuit C contains ICs 04 and 05</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The following three inter-subcircuit connections have also been identified:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connection from IC 00 to IC 02</li>
                        <li>Connection from IC 02 to IC 04</li>
                        <li>Connection from IC 03 to IC 05</li>
                        <li>Connection from IC 01 to IC 05</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In this example, subcircuit C is a terminal subcircuit and subcircuits A and B are internal
                        subcircuits. Thus, all connections terminating in subcircuit C must be shorted first:
                        02&RightTeeArrow;04, 03&RightTeeArrow;05, and 01&RightTeeArrow;05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this, subcircuit C is now disconnected and subcircuit B is now a terminal subcircuit.
                        Thus, all connections terminating in subcircuit B must be shorted next: 01&RightTeeArrow;05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this, all connections between subcircuits will have been shorted and the module will
                        disarm.
                    </p>
