                    <h2>On the Subject of Shorting Subcircuits</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">This circuit looks complicated, but maybe if I could break it down...</p>

                        Presented before you is a KTSS series logic board. Each KTSS series board controls a fundamental
                        part of any bomb, such as the timer, the strike controller, etc. To safely disarm the module,
                        you must identify subcircuits in logic board and short the connections between them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Identifying Subcircuits</h3>
                    <p>
                        A <em>subcircuit</em> is a set of integrated circuits (ICs) such that there exists a path for
                        electricity to flow between each pair of ICs, in both directions, in the set. Note that
                        electricity only flows along connections in one direction. There are several subcicuits present
                        on the logic board. Find all of them, then refer to "Shorting Connections."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To identify the ICs that are connected to a particular IC (i.e. the ICs that electricity can
                        <em>flow to</em> from a particular IC), place the red multimeter probe on an IC. This will cause
                        the LEDs associated with the probed IC and each connected IC to light up. To deselect an IC,
                        simply click on it again.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Shorting Connections</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once you have identified each subcircuit in the module, make a note of the subcircuit which does
                        not allow electricity to flow to any other subcircuit. This is called a
                        <em>primary subcircuit</em>. All other subcircuits (i.e., subcircuits where electricity can flow
                        from them to another subcircuit) are called <em>secondary subcircuits</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To safely short the connections between subcircuits without registering a strike with the
                        anti-tampering mechanism, you may only short connections from secondary subciruits to primary
                        subcircuits. Note that once a connection is shorted, a secondary subcircuit may become a primary
                        subcircuit. Once all connections between subcircuits are shorted, the module will be disarmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To short a connection, place the red probe on the IC where the connection originates in the
                        secondary subcircuit and place the black probe on the IC to which the electricity flows along
                        the connection in the primary subcircuit. The smart multimeter will automatically short the
                        connection after 2 seconds. Shorting any other connection or attempting to short a non-existant
                        connection will result in a strike.
